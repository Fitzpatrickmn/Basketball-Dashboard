# Basketball Dashboard

A deep-dive into NBA drafts, salaries, and colleges. Data sets: NBA Player Salaries - https://data.world/datadavis/nba-salaries & NBA Player Stats - https://www.kaggle.com/drgilermo/nba-players-stats. I used Google's Geo-coding API to get the coordinates of all the colleges, Python for data manipulation, cleaning and transformation, and used SQL to store the data. 
I then used HTML/CSS, Javascript, D3, Leaflet, and Plotly to create dynamic and interactive data visualizations. 

Out of the requirements I omitted using flask. For this to fully work, please use your own API KEY, as I've placed my config.js in a git ignore.
