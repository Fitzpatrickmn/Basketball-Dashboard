# Basketball Dashboard

A deep-dive into NBA drafts, salaries, and colleges. Data sets: NBA Player Salaries - https://data.world/datadavis/nba-salaries & NBA Player Stats - https://www.kaggle.com/drgilermo/nba-players-stats. Project completed using Google's Geo-coding API to obtain all college coordinates, Python for data manipulation, cleaning, and transformation, and SQL to query the data.  HTML/CSS, Javascript, d3.js, Leaflet, and Plotly were used to create dynamic and interactive data visualizations.

Out of the requirements I omitted using flask. For this to fully work, please use your own API KEY, as I've placed my config.js in a git ignore.
